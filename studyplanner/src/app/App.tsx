// I need my website to display two main large tiles that users can click on to navigate to one of two pages -->
// The first tile should be labeled "Manage Uni Units" and it should navigate to a page split into 4 quarters each indicating one unit -->  
// For each unit, there should be a list of assessments that students would input previously -->
// The assessments should be displayed in a table with text for the assessment name, due date, description, topics, and a dropdown for the type of assessment -->  
// The topics, description, due date, and dropdown for the type of assessment should be used by a generative ai model -->
// The generative ai model will create a calendar for the semester for the student with recommended study session dates, preparation materials, guides, resources, and an interesting add on such as a spotify study playlist that could be new for each session-->
// The second tile should be labeled "Manage Calendar" and it should navigate to a calendar page similar in layout to google calendar -->
// The calendar page will display the study sessions created from the first page, classes and assessment due dates -->
// These events can be clicked onto to get more information on that event-->
// The calendar page should also have a button to add a new event -->
// Both pages should have a button in the top left to navigate to the home page -->
// The home page should have a button in the top right to navigate to the user profile page -->
// Thats all that we should need now for website requirements-->
